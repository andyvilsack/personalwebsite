  <h2>Andrew Scott Vilsack</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
  Hello! I'm Andrew Vilsack, student at Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania.  From an early age I knew that computers and computing in general were always made for me.  From tinkering around in any program I could get my little hands on, to building my own computer in 10th grade, I always knew that technology was my calling.  Currently I am enrolled in the Computer Science concentration track of the Computing major at Slippery Rock University where I get the hands on programming experience that I know I'll need.  Outside of class I work in the Office of Web Communications at Slippery Rock as one of the student web developers.  This has truly helped me grow not only as a programmer, but as a person.  Being able to meet deadlines, making content that thousands of people see and use every day, and ensuring that everything works for everyone that needs it make the day worth it every time.  Thank you for reading and feel free to check out my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> of other projects that I've worked on, and to <a href="contact.php">contact</a> me if you have anything that you want to say.
